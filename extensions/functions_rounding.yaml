                - TRUNCATE: always round toward zero.
                - CEILING: always round toward positive infinity.

                - AWAY_FROM_ZERO: round negative values with FLOOR rule, round positive values with CEILING rule

                - TIE_TOWARDS_ZERO: round ties with TRUNCATE rule
                - TIE_TO_ODD: round to nearest value; if exactly halfway, tie
                  to the odd option.
