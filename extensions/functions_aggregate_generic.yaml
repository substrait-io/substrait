  - name: grouping
    description: >
      Indicates whether the column(s) in a GROUP BY list are aggregated or
      not. This function can be used to distinguish between a NULL value in
      the raw data vs the total across all values that are returned by ROLLUP,
      CUBE or GROUPING SETS for a specific column.
      
      Returns an integer value which is unique for each combination of
      grouping values. The return value can be interpreted as a bit vector
      where bits in the binary representation of the integer correspond to each
      grouping value.
      
      For a single grouping value, the result is 1 if the data is aggregated
      across the specified column or 0 for not aggregated in the result set.
