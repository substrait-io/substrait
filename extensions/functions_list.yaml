  - name: "transform"
    description: >-
      Transforms each element of a list using the provided function.
      Also known as "map" in functional programming.

      Returns a new list where each element is the result of applying
      the transformer to the corresponding element in the input list.

      The transformer receives one parameter (the current element) and must return
      the transformed value.
    impls:
      - args:
          - name: input
            value: list<any1>
          - name: transformer
            value: func<any1 -> any2>
        nullability: MIRROR
        return: list<any2>

  - name: "filter"
    description: >-
      Filters a list of elements based on a predicate function.

      Returns a new list containing only elements for which the predicate
      function returns true.

      The predicate receives one parameter (the current element) and must return a
      boolean.

      Elements for which the predicate returns true are included in the
      result. Elements for which the predicate returns false or null are excluded.
    impls:
      - args:
          - name: input
            value: list<any1>
          - name: predicate
            value: func<any1 -> boolean>
        nullability: MIRROR
        return: list<any1>
